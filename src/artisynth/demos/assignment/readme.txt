Model developed for a course, HG4049 The Meat of Speech, under the guidance
of Asst Prof Scott Moisik, at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

I realize this model should really belong in the artisynth_models repo, but
let's just say this was a consequence of being very new to Java when I started
working on it.

No worries -- I don't intend to be merging this to the main artisynth_core 
repo!


Loading this model:
    $ git clone https://github.com/ztxle/artisynth_core.git
    $ cd artisynth_core
    $ bin/artisynth -model artisynth.demos.assignment.VocalFolds
